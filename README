After the 02010 redesign of Twitter.com, some annoying changes we a constant bother. Rather than complaining, I decided not do something about it.

This is a custom CSS file that you load in the browser of your choice. It hides much of what is in the right-hand column.

Feel free to fork it, make/suggest changes.

Special thanks to @adactio for the seeds of this file.
